            <h2>NOTES</h2>
            <ol>
            <li>Many definitions of dance have been proposed. This definition is based on the following</li>
            <li>Dance is human movement created and expressed for an aesthetic purpose</li>
            <li>Dance is a transient mode of expression performed in a given form and style by the human body moving in space.</li>

        	<h1>DANCE</h1>
                <p>Dance is a performing art form consisting of sequences of movement, either improvised or purposefully selected. This movement has aesthetic and often symbolic value.[nb 1] Dance can be categorized and described by its choreography, by its repertoire of movements, or by its historical period or place of origin.</p>
             <h2>Performance and participation</h2>
         <p>Performance and participationMembers of an American jazz dance company perform a formal group routine in a concert dance setting
            Theatrical dance, also called performance or concert dance, is intended primarily as a spectacle, usually a performance upon a stage by virtuoso dancers. It often tells a story, perhaps using mime, costume and scenery, or else it may simply interpret the musical accompaniment, which is often specially composed and performed in a theatre setting but it is not a requirement.</p>
